# Essential Services and Vaccinated Drivers Identification System
## Itroduction
Affecting countries worldwide, the outbreak of the COVID-19 disease 
that began in Wuhan â€“ China in December 2019 is now taking over the world by storm. 
Although we are in dark era, but we have to fulfil our day today essential requirements. 
For that we have to perform that essential services to a minimum or functional level. 
Once the government gives permission for that, the behavior of the people is not optimistic. 
This essential service process make a massive impact in the spread of the disease.
## Project Background
In this situation, to maintain these essential services the government issue the essential 
permits and vaccination is carried out continuously. 
As well as, people have hug responsible A significant number of people are misusing permissions. 
They use fake essential services permits to escape the law. Otherwise, 
they are not involved in the correct vaccination process. 
Police officers have to fulfil large and heavy role control this situation.

## Problem Definition
At this moment, at normal roadblocks in Sri Lanka check the vehicles by police officers. 
In generally in the roadblocks, we park the vehicle and get out of the vehicle, 
go to near the  police officer. It is danger. Losing distance is main issue. 

If we will be able to check vehicle details using own system by checking vehicle number that is the way that we want. 
Then we able to verify the driver whether who is the person that mentioned name in permit.

In addition to that we are able to check driver got vaccine type and whether he missed some does. 
If he missed does officers can report it by using this system.

## Proposed Solution
To date, They do not have an information system for the convenience and safty of the officer who actively 
contribute to this process and to minimize the spread of the disease.

Therefore, we planned to develop a java-based system that enables police officers 
and police to solve this practical problem remotely and more securely and reliably.

## Objectives
We can find three categories of stakeholders in this problem and our final solution will be able to be a platform that helps the stakeholders in following ways.
### Police Officer
  * Police officer should be able to,
     - [x] Enter Vehicle Number
     - [x] Enter NIC Number
     - [x] Enter Driving Lichen Number
     - [x] View Vehicle details
     - [x] View whether vehicle is Essential service or not 
     - [x] Report complains (If he missed does)
     - [x] View whether he has vaccinated or not (id he is not a permit holder)  

### System Admin
  * System Admin should be able to,
     - [x] Add users
     - [x] Delete Users
     - [x] Update users
     - [x] Enter essential services vehicle details
     - [x] Delete essential services vehicle details
     - [x] Enter vaccination details
     
### Police station
  * Police station should be able to,
     - [x] View reported complains
     - [x] View number of checked vehicles
     - [x] Cancel permits
## We hope to develop the system using Java for to cover the above requirements.
